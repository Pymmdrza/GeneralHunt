#### Batch Check :

One of the unique and unique features of General Hunt is to crack the private key in bulk, which generates and scans a large number of addresses at the same time, which it displays for you in four tables on the main page of the software.

---

#### Radius :


RADIUS is another feature of the software that makes it possible for the user to display the addresses that are in the Ethereum network if they have another currency or token other than Ethereum and save them in a text file.

---

#### ETH Check :


If the generated address was in the set of addresses imported through Rich File, it will check and display the number of Ethereum transactions and its balance online.

---


#### Create Concurrently:


In this section, you can determine how many addresses to generate and display at the same time. My advice to you is to choose this number depending on the amount of RAM in your system so that you don't face slow production speed.


---


#### Observe:

In this section, you determine whether the addresses generated by hex or wif or dec are
The rest of the steps are not very complicated and do not need to be explained. Press the button as instructed in the video. But I will give you a brief explanation. After purchasing the two compressed files, the addresses of the wallets with high balance of Bitcoin and Ethereum will also be sent. After extracting them, upload the extracted text file to your relevant sections. For example: upload the Btc_2023.txt file in the Rich File BTC section and Eth_2023.txt in the Rich File ETH
Of course, do this if you do not have the list of wallets. These two files are the latest addresses and have been updated, and this list of wallets is recommended.

#### After installing the software

After you have successfully installed the software, as you can see, two shortcuts have been created on your desktop, one of which is related to General Hunt and the other is a text file with the name Found in text format. In the text file, it saves the set of addresses that the program finds successfully and matches, their private key and other details in that file.

#### Video :

In this video, you can clearly see how to make the first simple settings. (Of course, the software is set in such a way that it does not require changes in the initial settings, and the user only needs to enter the rich wallet file and specify the number of production and display and click on the green start button)

In this video, you will see how I managed to find three Bitcoin Ethereum
